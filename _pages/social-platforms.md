Here is a list of social platforms that I actively use. Follow me if you want but note that I won't add anyone I don't know, so sorry in advance!

## [GitHub](https://github.com/Joehuu)

This is where this site is hosted and where the osu! source code is for me to contribute. I also maintain a Rainmeter suite, but it's somewhat unpolished so YMMV.

## Discord: joehuu

I regularly check on the [osu! server](https://discord.gg/ppy) every day.

## [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8549835)

This is the game that I initially had no interest in, but later, I am and now, I contribute code to it.

## [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Joehu)

You know why. Though anime came before osu! for me. There were those Dragon Ball episodes on Cartoon Network / Adult Swim when I still had DirecTV.

## [MyFigureCollection](https://myfigurecollection.net/profile/Joehu)

I joined recently after buying and receiving a mystery box (GSC Year of the Rabbit Box 2023). I wanted a way to liven up the room.
