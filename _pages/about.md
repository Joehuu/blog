Hey there.

I'm a person who likes to try new and underrated things. My main hobby is contributing to my favorite open-source game, [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu). I also dabbled in DIY electronic repair with mostly just attempts and some successes, renovating my home, collecting figures, and playing with different keyboard switches.

You can find me on these [social platforms](social).
